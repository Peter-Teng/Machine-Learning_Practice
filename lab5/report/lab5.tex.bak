\section{Introduction}
	% \PARstart{}{} creates a tall first letter for this first paragraph
\PARstart{T}{he} recommender system has been developed as an independent discipline for nearly twenty years but not yet has a precise definition. Several strategies have been proposed in the way to constructing a more accurate and more useful model, such as Content-based Algorithm, Item-based Collaborative Filtering Algorithm and Matrix Factorization Algorithm. In this lab, we will work on a Matrix Factorization model, which put the observed samples in a sparse matrix and try to decompose it through introducing a new parameter K, which tries to identify the potential features of each user and each item. The main goals of the lab are completely generating a movie recommender system and cultivate engineering ability under a small dataset.

% Main Part
\section{Methods and Theory}
Before constructing a recommender system using matrix factorization, there are some concepts we need to introduce. A matrix $R \in \mathbb{R} ^ {m*n}$ is a sparse rating matrix for m users and n items(movies in this case). An observed samples $r_{u,i}$ (means the rate of user $u$ towards item(movie) $i$) will be represented as a specific value in $R$. In the matrix factorization method we use, we will try to decompose $R$ into two matrices $P \in \mathbb{R} ^ {m*k}$ and $Q \in \mathbb{R} ^ {k*n}$ where k denotes potential features for each user and movie.
\begin{figure}[!hbt]
	% Center the figure.
	\begin{center}
	% Include the eps file, scale it such that it's width equals the column width. You can also put width=8cm for example...
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{matrix_decompose.png}
	% Create a subtitle for the figure.
	\caption{An illustration of matrix factorization (m=4, n=4, k=2).}
	% Define the label of the figure. It's good to use 'fig:title', so you know that the label belongs to a figure.
	\label{fig1}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}\\
After confirming the basic skeleton of our model, the next step is to determine how we evaluate the goodness of it and the way we optimize it. A naive loss function is squared error loss:
\begin{equation}
    L(r_{u,i},\hat{r}_{u,i}) = (r_{u,i}-\hat{r}_{u,i})^2
\end{equation}\\
Besides, there are two ways to minimize the loss on our lab guidance alternate least squares optimization(ALS) and stochastic gradient descent method(SGD). I chose SGD as my strategy to optimize, because it is a simple and scalable to large-scale datasets way compared to ALS.\\
In stochastic gradient descent, we define the loss function as below:
\begin{equation}
    L = \sum_{u,i\in \Omega} (r_{u,i} - p_u^T q_i)^2 + \lambda_p||p_u||^2+\lambda_q||q_i||^2
\end{equation}\\
$r_{u,i}$ denotes the actual rating of user u for item i.
$\Omega$ denotes the set of observed samples from rating matrix R.
$\lambda_p$ and $\lambda_q$ are regularization parameters to avoid overtting.
In order to minimize the loss and update our matrices P and Q, there are two other important formulas which we use to calculate gradient:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial l}{\partial p_u} = E_{u,i}(-q_i)+\lambda_pp_u & \\
    \frac{\partial l}{\partial q_i} = E_{u,i}(-p_u)+\lambda_qq_i
\end{align}
